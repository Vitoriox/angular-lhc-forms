# Angular LHC-Forms

This is an attempt to make an angular library to wrap the [LHC-Forms](http://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/#rendering) package in a neat and usable way by angular users

## Structure
In the projects folder there are 2 directories:
 - `angular-lhc-forms`: Wrapper library of the Lforms package
 - `demo`: Simple angular app to live-test the library

## Running the application
To test the library first you have to build it with the next command
```ng build angular-lhc-forms```
And the run the demo application ``ng serveserve --project=demo``
